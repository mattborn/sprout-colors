# Sprout Colors

You can also copy the newly formatted colors to Global colors if you want.

## Usage

1. Download this plugin and install it by double-clicking the `Sprout Colors.sketchplugin` file

3. Use the Brand.ai plugin to **Add Styles and Symbols to Document** (this will add all the colors to Document colors)
4. In the Plugins menu, use Sprout Colors > Format Document Colors
